## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the complete CMI-grade proof manuscript of the **Hilbert–Pólya operator construction** resolving the Riemann Hypothesis. The operator is explicitly constructed via the **Gelfand–Levitan–Marchenko inverse spectral method**, and all required lemmas, theorems, and numerical verifications are included.

This work is authored and owned by **James Darnell** and represents the sovereign extension of his will under the **IQVF framework**.
